        As a mother of two kids, navigating the constant demands of family life while transitioning
        from my career as an elementary school teacher to a full-time wellness blogger, finding an
        effective weight loss method that could seamlessly fit into my busy routine was no easy
        task. The daily pressures of parenting, coupled with the challenges of maintaining a healthy
        lifestyle amidst school runs, meal preps, and family commitments, made it difficult to stick
        to any weight management plan.
