        After trying so many ways to lose weight and getting all sorts of results, I decided to make
        a simple chart. This chart comes from my own trials and shows what really helped me, what
        truly worked, what was easy to maintain, and what gave me lasting results. I've ranked the
        methods from most to least favoured and scored them from 5 to 1, where 5 is the top score
        and 1 the lowest.
