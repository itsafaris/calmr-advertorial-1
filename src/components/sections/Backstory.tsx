        I'm {siteConfig.personaName}, a 51-year-old mother of three fantastic kids: Emma (9), Joseph
        (11) and Mathew (15). With my caring husband by my side, juggling a career and raising a
        family is gratifying, but it leaves little room for focusing on myself.

        <SBoldText>I've always had challenges with my weight.</SBoldText> I've never been the slim
        type, constantly feeling out of place with the narrow beauty standards around us. My journey
        has been a series of highs and lows, trying out everything from weight loss programs and
        appetite suppressants to fat-burning injections and metabolism boosters.

      <SText>
        I've experienced hunger pangs, battled intense cravings, and dealt with side effects like
        digestive issues, nervousness, constipation, mood swings, and the frustration of seeing
        little to no progress on the scale.
      </SText>

      <SText>
        In moments of desperation, I've turned to quick-fix solutionsâ€”appetite suppressants, and
        even injections like Ozempic. Sure, I'd lose some weight and feel a brief sense of
        achievement, but the weight always returned, sometimes even more than before.
      </SText>

      <SText>
        This struggle has been real. Constant hunger, fighting off cravings, and the cycle of
        short-lived success followed by regaining the weight (and more) left me exhausted.{" "}
        <SBoldText>
          My goal wasn't just to find a "healthier me", but to lose the weight, feel lighter, and
          break free from the endless loop of diet frustrations.
